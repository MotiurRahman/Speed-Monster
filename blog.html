        <h1>1. What is the difference between local storage and session storage.</h1>
        <p>Ans: sessionStorage is similar to localStorage, the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't
            expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a
            particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.</p>

        <h1>2. What is the difference between global scope and block scope.</h1>
        <p>Block Level Scope: This scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific block, from access by
            the outside of the block. The let & const keyword facilitates the variables to be block scoped.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Global scope: In a programming environment, the global scope is the scope that contains, and is visible in,
            all other
            scopes. In client-side JavaScript, the global scope is generally the web page inside which all the code is
            being executed</p>
