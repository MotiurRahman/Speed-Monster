        <h2>1. What is the difference between local storage and session storage.</h2>
        <p>Ans: sessionStorage is similar to localStorage, the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't
            expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a
            particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.</p>

        <h2>2. What is the difference between global scope and block scope.</h2>
        <p>Block Level Scope: This scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific block, from access by
            the outside of the block. The let & const keyword facilitates the variables to be block scoped.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Global scope: In a programming environment, the global scope is the scope that contains, and is visible in,
            all other
            scopes. In client-side JavaScript, the global scope is generally the web page inside which all the code is
            being executed</p>

        <h2>3. How event loop works in JavaScript.</h2>
        <p>Ans. The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations. When an
            asynchronous
            task is started, the event loop will start running. Once the task is completed, the event loop will again
            check for any other tasks that need to be performed.</p>
